// Instructions for safely setting up the API key:
/*
For security reasons, do not store the API key in your code. 
Instead, follow these best practices:

1. For development:
   - Use environment variables in .env files (not committed to source control)
   - Use secure vaults or secret management services

2. For production:
   - Use environment variables set in your hosting platform
   - Use a backend service to handle API requests with the key
   - Use a serverless function as a proxy for API calls
